# Hey, I'm Bakkesh KS 👋  
Solo founder. AI enthusiast. Builder on a mission to hit $1M ARR.

## 🚀 What I'm Building
I craft fast, lean MVPs for startups and solo founders who want results not fluff.  
Currently deep in the trenches building:

- 🧠 AI Agents that think before they act  
- 🕸️ Web scrapers that don’t sleep  
- 🛠️ SaaS tools that solve real problems  
- 🏪 Marketplace apps that connect the dots

## 💡 Why I Build
Because I love turning ideas into products.  
Because AI is the future—and I want to shape it.  
Because solo doesn’t mean small.


## 🛠️ My Tech Stack

- **Tools & Languages**: Python, TypeScript, N8N, CrewAI, Mastra AI, Apify
